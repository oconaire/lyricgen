I walked along the avenue.
I never thought I’d meet a girl like you;
Meet a girl like you.
With auburn hair and tawny eyes;
The kind of eyes that hypnotize me through;
Hypnotize me through.

And I ran, I ran so far away.
I just ran, I ran all night and day.
I couldn’t get away.

A cloud appears above your head;
A beam of light comes shining down on you,
Shining down on you.
The cloud is moving nearer still.
Aurora borealis comes in view;
Aurora comes in view.

And I ran, I ran so far away.
I just ran, I ran all night and day.
I couldn’t get away.

Reached out a hand to touch your face;
You’re slowly disappearing from my view;
Disappearing from my view.
Reached out a hand to try again;
I’m floating in a beam of light with you;
A beam of light with you.

And I ran, I ran so far away.
I just ran, I ran all night and day.
I couldn’t get away.

40 Most Awesomely Bad Metal Songs Ever.

Too many slaves in this world
Die by torture and pain
Too many people do not see
They’re killing themselves - going insane

Too many people do not know
Bondage is over the human race
They believe slaves always lose
And this fear keeps them down

Watch the damned (God bless ya)
They’re gonna break their chains (hey)
No, you can’t stop them (God bless ya)
They’re coming to get you
And then you’ll get your

Balls to the wall, man
Balls to the wall
You’ll get your balls to the wall, man
Balls to the wall - balls to the wall

You may screw their brains
You may sacrifice them, too
You may mortify their flesh
You may rape them all

One day the tortured stand up
And revolt against the evil
They make you drink your blood
And tear yourself to pieces

You better watch the damned (God bless ya)
They’re gonna break their chains (hey)
No, you can’t stop them (God bless ya)
They’re coming to get you
And then you’ll get your

Balls to the wall, man
Balls to the wall
You’ll get your balls to the wall, man
Balls to the wall - balls to the wall

Come on man, let’s stand up all over the world
Let’s plug a bomb in everyone’s arse
If they don’t keep us alive - we’re gonna fight for the right

Build a wall with the bodies of the dead - and you’re saved
Make the world scared - come on, show me the sign of victory
Sign of victory - sign of victory

You better watch the damned (God bless ya)
They’re gonna break their chains (hey)
No, you can’t stop them (God bless ya)
They’re coming to get you
And then you’ll get your

Balls to the wall, man
Balls to the wall

LYRICS:
----------------
Ricky was a young boy, He had a heart of stone.
Lived 9 to 5 and worked his fingers to the bone.
Just barely got out of school, came from the edge of town.
Fought like a switchblade so no one could take him down.
He had no money, oooh no good at home.
He walked the streets a soldier and he fought the world alone
And now it's

18 and life You got it
18 and life you know
Your crime is time and it's
18 and life to go

Tequila in his heartbeat, His veins burned gasoline.
It kept his motor running but it never kept him clean.
They say he loved adventure, "Ricky's the wild one."
He married trouble and had a courtship with a gun.
Bang Bang Shoot 'em up, The party never ends.
You can't think of dying when the bottle's your best friend
And now it's

18 and life You got it
18 and life you know
Your crime is time and it's
18 and life to go

"Accidents will happen" they all heard Ricky say
He fired his six-shot to the wind that blew a child away.

18 and life You got it
18 and life you know
Your crime is time and it's
18 and life to go

Babe, it wasn't easy to leave you alone
It's getting harder each time that I go
If I had the choice, I would stay

Girl, there are really no words strong enough
To describe all my longing for love
I don't want my feelings restrained
Ooh, babe, I just need you like never before
Just imagine you'd come through this door
You'd take all my sorrow away

There's no one like you
I can't wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things we'll do

LYRICS:
----------------
I never meant to be so bad to you
One thing I said that I would never do
A look from you and I would fall from grace
And it would wipe the smile right from my face

Do you remember when we used to dance
And incidents arose from circumstance
One thing led to another, we were young
And we would scream together songs unsung

It was the heat of the moment
Telling me what my heart menat
The heat of the moment showed in your eyes

And now you find yourself in '82
The disco hot spots hold no charm for you
You can concern yourself with bigger things
You catch a pearl and ride the dragon's wings

It was the heat of the moment
Telling me what my heart menat
The heat of the moment showed in your eyes

And when your looks have gone and you're alone
How many nights you sit beside the phone
What were the things you wanted for yourself
Teenage ambitions you remember well

It was the heat of the moment
Telling me what my heart menat
The heat of the moment showed in your eyes

LYRICS:
----------------
I've been drivin' all night, my hands are wet on the wheel.
There's a voice in my head that drives my heel.
My baby call said I need you here.
It's half past four and I'm shifting gears.

When she gets lonely and the longing gets too much,
She sends a cable coming in from above.
Don't need a phone at all.
We got a thing that's called radar love
We got a wave in the air
Radar love

The radio's playin' some forgotten song.
Revelrie's coming on strong.
The road has got me hypnotized,
As I spin into a new sunrise.

When I get lonely and I'm sure I've had enough,
She sends comfort coming in from above.
Don't need no letters at all.
We got a thing that's called radar love
We got a line in the sky

No more speed I'm almost there.
Gotta keep cool, now, gotta take care.
Last car to pass, here I go.
The line of cars drove down real slow.
The radio plays that forgotten song.
Brenda Lee's coming on strong.
The news man sang his same song,
One more radar lover gone.

When I'm feeling lonely and I'm sure I've had enough.
She sends the comfort coming in from above.
Don't need no radio at all
We got a thing that's called radar love
We got a light in the sky
We got a thing and its called radar love
We got a thing that's called
Radar love

Takin' up arms
Bringin' the metal back to where it belongs!

And the wings of a Bat
Because it's Midnite

Liquid 'n' Leather
In equal measure

Mix 'em together
Sweet city sweat
Vampire love
Crimson falls down
From the wings of a dove
Floating over the pavement
Guitars take flight
Wearin' my tightest pants
Because it's Midnite!

Heart of a Lion
And the wings of a Bat
Because it's Midnite
(I've got the)
Heart of a Lion
And the wings of a Bat
Because it's Midnite

No need to look so afraid

Jump on the tiger
You can feel his heart but you know he's mean
Some light can never be seen

You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh what's becoming of me

Ride the tiger
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh don't you see what I mean

LYRICS:
----------------
Another suburban family morning
Grandmother screaming at the wall

We have to shout above the din of our rice crispies
We can't hear anything at all
Mother chants her litany of boredom and frustration
But we know all her suicides are fake
Daddy only stares into the distance
There's only so much more that he can take
Many miles away
Something crawls from the slime
At the bottom of a dark
Scottish lake

Another industrial ugly morning
The factory belches filth into the sky
He walks unhindered through the picket lines today
He doesn't think to wonder why
The secretaries pout and preen like cheap tarts in a red light street
But all he ever thinks to do is watch
And every single meeting with his so called superior
Is a humiliating kick in the crotch
Many miles away
Something crawls to the surface
Of a dark Scottish loch

Another working day has ended
Only the rush hour hell to face
Packed like lemmings into shiny metal boxes
Contestants in a suicidal race
Daddy grips the wheel and stares alone into the distance
He knows that something somewhere has to break
He sees the family home now looming in his headlights
The pain upstairs that makes his eyeballs ache
Many miles away
There's a shadow on the door
Of a cottage on the shore
Of a dark Scottish lake

Many miles away...
Many miles away...
Many miles away...
Many miles away...
Many miles away...

Oh yeah, it was like lightning, everybody was frightening
And the music was soothing, and they all started grooving

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

Everyone attacked and it turned into a ballroom blitz
And the girl in the corner said
Boy, I wanna warn ya, it'll turn into a ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz, ballroom blitz, ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz

It's it's a ballroom blitz, it's it's a ballroom blitz
It's it's a ballroom blitz, yeah, it's a ballroom blitz

4. "Only a Lad" by Oingo Boingo
===============================================================
Trivia: The singer of the band Oingo Boingo was Danny Elfman, 
who has written pretty much every song for Tim Burton's films, 
and the Simpsons theme!

LYRICS:
----------------
Johnny was bad, even as a child everybody could tell
Everyone said if you don't get straight
You'll surely go to hell

But Johnny didn't care
He was an outlaw by the time that he was
Ten years old
He didn't wanna do what he was told
Just a prankster, juvenile gangster

His teachers didn't understand
They kicked him out of school
At a tender early age
Just because he didn't want to learn things
(Had other interests)
He liked to burn things

The lady down the block
She had a radio that Johnny wanted oh so bad
So he took it the first chance he had
Then he shot her in the leg
And this is what she said
Only a lad
You really can't blame him
Only a lad
Society made him
Only a lad
He's our responsibility
Only a lad
He really couldn't help it
Only a lad
He didn't want to do it
Only a lad
He's underprivileged and abused
Perhaps a little bit confused

His parents gave up they couldn't influence his attitude
Nobody could help
The little man had no gratitude

And when he stole the care
Nobody dreamed that he would
Try to take it so far
He didn't mean to kill the poor man
Who had to go and die
It made the judge cry

Only a lad
He really couldn't help it
Only a lad
He didn't want to do it
Only a lad
He's underprivileged and abused
Perhaps a little bit confused

It's not his fault that he can't believe
It's not his fault that he can't behave
Society made him go astray
Perhaps if we're nice he'll go away
Perhaps he'll go away
He'll go away

(Repeat chorus)

Hey there Johnny you really don't fool me
You get away with murder
And you think it's funny
You don't give a damn if we live or if we die
Hey there Johnny boy
I hope you fry

5. "Round and Round" by Ratt 
===============================================================
Trivia: Different songs under the same name were played by Aerosmith 
and David Bowie (both artists who have appeared in Guitar Hero games), 
although the three songs have very few similarities.

LYRICS:
----------------
Out on the streets, that's where we'll meet
You make the night, I always cross the line
Tightened our belts, abuse ourselves
Get in our way, we'll put you on your shelf
Another day, some other way
We're gonna go, but then we'll see you again
I've had enough, we've had enough
Cold in vain, she said

I knew right from the beginning
That you would end up winnin'
I knew right from the start
You'd put an arrow through my heart

Round and round
With love we'll find a way just give it time
Round and round
What comes around goes around
I'll tell you why

Dig

Lookin' at you, lookin' at me
The way you move, you know it's easy to see
The neon light's on me tonight
I've got a way, we're gonna prove it tonight
Like Romeo to Juliet
Time and time, I'm gonna make you mine
I've had enough, we've had enough
It's all the same, she said

I knew right from the beginning
That you would end up winnin'
I knew right from the start
You'd put an arrow through my heart

Round and round
With love we'll find a way just give it time
Round and round
What comes around goes around
I'll tell you why

Yeah!

Solo

Out on the streets, that's where we'll meet
You make the night, I always cross the line
Tightened our belts, abuse ourselves
Get in our way, we'll put you on your shelf

Round and round
With love we'll find a way just give it time
Round and round
What comes around goes around
I'll tell you why

Round and round
With love we'll find a way just give it time, time, time, time
Round and round
What comes around goes around
I'll tell you why, why, why, why
Round and round

1. "Ain't Nothin' But a Good Time" by Poison
===============================================================
Trivia: This song is actually called Nothin' But a Good Time.

LYRICS:
----------------
Now Listen
Not a dime, I can't pay my rent
I can barely make it through the week
Saturday night I'd like to make my girl
But right now I can't make ends meet

I'm always workin' slavin' every day
Gotta get away from that same old same old
I need a chance just to get away
If you could hear me think this is what I'd say

Don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist
Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this

They say I spend my money on women and wine
But I couldn't tell you where I spent last night
I'm really sorry about the shape I'm in
I just like my fun every now and then

I'm always workin' slavin' every day
Gotta get away from that same old same old
I need a chance just to get away
If you could hear me think this is what I'd say
Don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist
Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this

You see I raise a toast to all of us
Who are breakin' our backs every day
If wantin' the good life is such a crime
Lord, then put me away
Here's to ya

Solo

Chorus (3x's)

2. "Lonely is the Night" by Billy Squier
===============================================================
LYRICS:
----------------
Lonely is the night when you find yourself alone
Your demons come to light and your mind is not your own
Lonely is the night when there's no one left to call
You feel the time is right--(say) the writin's on the wall

It's a high time to fight when the walls are closin' in
Call it what you like--It's time you got to win
Lonely, lonely, lonely--your spirit's sinkin' down
You find you're not the only stranger in this town

Red lights, green lights, stop 'n go jive
Headlines, deadlines jammin' your mind
You been stealin' shots from the side
Let your feelin's go for a ride

There's danger out tonight..the man is on the prowl
Get the dynamite...the boys are set to howl
Lonely is the night when you hear the voices call
Are you ready for a fight--do you wanna take it all

Slowdown, showdown--waitin' on line
Showtime, no time for changin' your mind
Streets are ringin', march to the sound
Let your secrets follow you down

Somebody's watchin' you baby--so much you can do
Nobody's stoppin' you baby, from makin' it too
One glimpse'll show you now baby, what the music can do
One kiss'll show you now baby--it can happen to you

No more sleepin', wastin' our time
Midnight creepin's first on our minds
No more lazin' 'round the tv
You'll go crazy--come out with me

3. "Bathroom Wall" by Faster Pussycat
===============================================================
Trivia: This song deals with graffiti left on a bathroom stall wall 
that singer Taime Downe saw backstage at a gig the band were playing 
prior to getting signed.

LYRICS:
Saw your number written on the wall
Said for a good time call Call 281-7668
Hey baby I can't wait I got your number off the bathroom wall

Pick up the phone and I start to think
I get excited when it starts to ring
I want you to go or stay If it's good I'll call her everyday
I got your number off the bathroom wall

Got your number off the bathroom wall
And I decided it was about time I made the call

You answered the phone in a sexy voice
I got excited and I had no choice
To put another dime in the telephone Cuz my number's alone at home
I got your number off the bathroom wall

Got your number off the bathroom wall
And I decided it was about time I made the call

Saw your number written on the wall
Said for a good time call Call 281-7668
Hey baby I can't wait I got your number off the bathroom wall

Got your number off the bathroom wall
And I decided it was about time I made the call
Got your number off the bathroom wall
Boy Am I lucky that I didn't use the other stall

She had to leave
Los angeles
She found it hard to say goodbye to her own best friend
She bought a clock on hollywood blvd the day she left
It felt sad, it felt sad

Flying over the dateline her hands turn red
Cause the days change at night

She bought a clock on hollywood blvd the day she left

Flying over the dateline her hands turn red

5. "Wrathchild" by Iron Maiden 
===============================================================
LYRICS:
----------------
I was born into a scene
of angriness and greed
of dominance and persecution

My mother was a queen
my dad I'd never seen
I was never meant to be.

Now I spend my time
looking all around
For a man that's nowhere to
be found,
Until I find him, I'm never
gonna stop searching,
I'm gonna find my man,
gonna travel round

Cos I'm a wrathchild
Well I'm a wrathchild
Yeah I'm a wrathchild

Some say it shouldn't matter,
ain't nothing gonna alter
the course of my destination

But I know I've gotta find
some serious peace of mind
or I know I'll just go crazy.

1. "Electric Eye" by Judas Priest
===============================================================
Trivia: The intro to this song is called "The Hellion"

LYRICS:
----------------
Up here in space
I'm looking down on you.
My lasers trace
Everything you do.
You think you've private lives
Think nothing of the kind.
There is no true escape

I'm watching all the time.
I'm made of metal
My circuits gleam.
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean.

I'm elected electric spy
I protected electric eye.
Always in focus
You can't feel my stare.
I zoom into you
You don't know I'm there.
I take a pride in probing all your secret moves
My tearless retina takes pictures that can prove.

Electric eye, in the sky
Feel my stare, always there
's nothing you can do about it.
Develop and expose
I feed upon your every thought
And so my power grows.
Protected. Detective. Electric eye.

2. "Police Truck" by Dead Kennedys
===============================================================
Trivia: This song later appears in the soundtrack of the popular 
skateboarding video game Tony Hawk's Pro Skater

LYRICS:
----------------
Tonight’s the night that we got the truck
We’re goin’ downtown gonna beat up punks
Your turn to drive I’ll bring the gear
And ride, ride how we ride
We ride, lowride

It’s roundup time where the good girls meet
Gonna drag one screaming off the street

And ride, ride how we ride

Got a black uniform and a silver badge
Playin’ cops for real/playin’ cops for pay

Let’s ride, lowride

Pull down your dress here’s a kick in the butt
Let’s beat you blue ’til you're loosing your pants
Don’t move, child got a big black stick
There’s six of us babe, so take your pick

And ride, ride how we ride
Let’s ride, lowride

The left newspapers might whine a bit
But the guys at the station they don’t give a fit
Dispatch calls "are you doin’ something wicked? "
"no siree, jack, we’re just givin’ tickets"

As we ride, ride, how we ride
Let’s ride, lowride

3. "Seventeen" by Winger
===============================================================
LYRICS:
----------------
I saw sparks fly, from the corner of my eye
And when I turned, it was love at first sight
I said please excuse me, I didn't catch your name
Oh it'd be a shame not to see you again

And just when I thought she was comin' to my door
She whispered sweet and brought me to the floor, she said

I'm only seventeen, but I'll show you love like you've never seen
She's only seventeen, daddy says she's too young, but she's old enough for me

Come to my place, we can talk it over, oh everything going down in your head
She said take it easy, I need some time, time to work it out, to make you mine

And just when I thought she was comin' to my door
She whispered sweet and brought me to the floor, she said

I'm only seventeen, you ain't seen love, ain't seen nothing like me
She's only seventeen, seventeen

Such a bad girl, loves to work me overtime
Feels good (ha), dancin' close to the borderline
She's a magic mountain, she's a leather glove
Oh she's my soul, it must be love

She's only seventeen, still she gives me love, like I've never seen
She's only seventeen, daddy says she's too young, but she's old enough for me
She's everything I need, daddy says she's too young
But she's old enough, old enough for me

4. "Caught in a Mosh" by Anthrax
===============================================================
Trivia: The song uses the metaphor of being caught in a "mosh" 
to represent the frustration of talking to racists.

LYRICS:
----------------
Why don’t you listen to me when I try to talk to you
Stop thinking of yourself, for just a second fool
Shut up, shut up, I don’t wanna hear your mouth
Your mother made a monster,
Now get the hell out of my house
Bridgecan’t stand it for another day
I ain’t gonna live my life this way
Cold sweat, my fists are clenching
Stomp, stomp, stomp the idiot convention

Which one of these words don’t you understand
I’m caught in a mosh!
Talking to you is like clapping with one hand

What is it? -- caught in a mosh!
What is it? -- caught in a mosh!

Don’t tell me how to do my job
There’s the door, your name’s on the knob
You’re always in the way, like a beast on my back
Were you dropped as a baby, cause brains you lack
Can’t stand it for another day
I ain’t gonna live my life this way
Cold sweat, my fists are clenching
Stomp, stomp, stomp, the idiot convention
Which one of these words don’t you understand?

I’m caught in a mosh
Talking to you, is like clapping with one hand
What is it? -- caught in a mosh!
What is it? -- caught in a mosh!

Think-before you speak
Or suffer for your words
Learn, to give respect
That others, give to you
Aaaaaaaaaaah, the best you can do

Hey man!
I’m trying to reason but you don’t understand
Talking in circles, we’ll never get it straight
Just you and me in our theatre of hate
Can’t stand it for another day
I ain’t gonna live my life this way
Cold sweat, my fists are clenching
Stomp, stomp, stomp, the idiot convention
Which one of these words don’t you understand?

I’m caught in a mosh!
Talking to you, is like clapping with one hand
What is it? -- caught in a mosh!
What is it? -- caught in a mosh!
