Something has to change
Un-deniable dilemma
Boredom's not a burden
Anyone should bear

Constant over stimulation numbs me
and I wouldn't have
It any other way

It's not enough
I need more
Nothing seems to satisfy
I don't want it
I just need it
To feel, to breathe, to know I'm alive

Finger deep within the borderline
Show me that you love me and that we belong together
Relax, turn around and take my hand

I can help you change
Tired moments into pleasure
Say the word and we'll be
Well upon our way

Blend and balance
Pain and comfort
Deep within you
Till you will not have me any other way

It's not enough
I need more
Nothing seems to satisfy
I don't want it
I just need it
To feel, to breathe, to know I'm alive

Knuckle deep inside the borderline
This may hurt a little, but it's something you'll get used to
Relax...slip away

Something kinda sad about
the way that things have come to be
Desensitized to everything
What became of subtlety?

How can it mean anything to me
If I really don't feel anything at all?

I'll keep digging till
I feel something

Elbow deep inside the borderline
Show me that you love me and that we belong together
Shoulder deep within the borderline
Relax...turn around and take my hand.

@SONG: Eulogy

He had a lot to say
He had a lot of nothing to say
We'll miss him

So long
We wish you well
You told us how you weren't afraid to die
Well then, so long
Don't cry
Or feel too down
Not all martyrs see divinity
But at least you tried

Standing above the crowd,
He had a voice that was strong and loud
We'll miss him
Ranting and pointing his finger
At everything but his heart
We'll miss him

No way to recall
What it was that you had said to me,
Like I care at all

So loud
You sure could yell
You took a stand on every little thing
And so loud

Standing above the crowd,
He had a voice so strong and loud and I
Swallowed his facade cuz I'm so
Eager to identify with
Someone above the ground,
Someone who seemed to feel the same,
Someone prepared to lead the way, with
Someone who would die for me

Will you? Will you now?
Would you die for me?
Don't you fuckin' lie

Don't you step out of line
Don't you fuckin' lie

You've claimed all this time that you would die for me
Why, then, are you so surprised to hear your own eulogy?

You had a lot to say
You had a lot of nothing to say

Come down
Get off your fuckin' cross
We need the fuckin' space to nail the next fool martyr

To ascend, you must die
You must be crucified
For your sins and your lies
Goodbye.

@SONG: H

What's coming through is alive
What's holding up is a mirror
But what's singing songs is a snake
Looking to turn this piss to wine

They're both totally void of hate,
But killing me just the same

The snake behind me hisses
What my damage could have been
My blood before me begs me
Open up my heart again

And I feel this coming over like a storm again
Considerately

Venomous voice, tempts me,
Drains me, bleeds me,
Leaves me cracked and empty
Drags me down like some sweet gravity

The snake behind me hisses
What my damage could have been
My blood before me begs me
Open up my heart again

And I feel this coming over like a storm again

I am too connected to you to
Slip away, to fade away
Days away, I still feel you
Touching me, changing me,
And considerately killing me

Without the skin,
Beneath the storm,
Under these tears
The walls came down

And the snake is drowned and
As I look in his eyes,
My fear begins to fade
Recalling all of those times

I could have cried then
I should have cried then

And as the walls come down and
As I look in your eyes
My fear begins to fade
Recalling all of the times
I have died
and will die
It's all right
I don't mind

I am too connected to you to
Slip away, to fade away
Days away, I still feel you
Touching me, changing me,

And considerately killing me.

@SONG: Forty-Six and 2

My shadow's
Shedding skin and
I've been picking
Scabs again
I'm down
Digging through
My old muscles
Looking for a clue

I've been crawling on my belly
Clearing out what could've been
I've been wallowing in my own confused
And insecure delusions
For a piece to cross me over
Or a word to guide me in
I wanna feel the changes coming down
I wanna know what I've been hiding in

My shadow
Change is coming through my shadow
My shadow's shedding skin
I've been picking
My scabs again

I've been crawling on my belly
Clearing out what could've been
I've been wallowing in my own chaotic
And insecure delusions

I wanna feel the change consume me,
Feel the outside turning in
I wanna feel the metamorphosis and
Cleansing I've endured within

My shadow
Change is coming
Now is my time
Listen to my muscle memory
Contemplate what I've been clinging to
Forty-six and two ahead of me

I choose to live and to
Grow, take and give, and to
Move, learn and love, and to
Cry, kill and die, and to
Be paranoid, and to
Lie, hate and fear, and to
Do what it takes to move through
I choose to live, and to
Lie, kill and give, and to
Die, learn and love, and to
Do what it takes to step through

See my shadow changing,
Stretching up and over me
Soften this old armor
Hoping I can clear the way
By stepping through my shadow,
Coming out the other side
Step into the shadow
Forty six and two are just ahead of me.



@SONG: Hooker with a Penis

I met a boy wearing Vans, 501s, and a
Dope Beastie t, nipple rings, and
New tattoos that claimed that he
Was OGT,
From '92,
The first EP

And in between
Sips of Coke
He told me that
He thought
We were sellin' out,
Layin' down,
Suckin' up
To the man

Well now, I've got some
Advice for you, little buddy
Before you point the finger
You should know that
I'm the man,

And if I'm the man,
Then you're the man, and
He's the man as well, so you can
Point that fuckin' finger up your ass

All you know about me is what I've sold you,
Dumb fuck
I sold out long before you ever heard my name

I sold my soul to make a record,
Dipshit,
And you bought one

So I've got some
Advice for you, little buddy
Before you point your finger
You should know that
I'm the man,
If I'm the fuckin' man
Then you're the fuckin' man as well
So you can
Point that fuckin' finger up your ass

All you know about me is what I've sold you,
Dumb fuck
I sold out long before you ever heard my name

I sold my soul to make a record,
Dipshit,
And you bought one

All you read and
Wear or see and
Hear on TV
Is a product
Begging for your
Fatass dirty
Dollar

So...shut up and

Buy my new record
Send more money
Fuck you, buddy.




@SONG: Jimmy

What was it like to see
The face of your own stability
Suddenly look away
Leaving you with the dead and hopeless?

Eleven and she was gone
Eleven is when we waved good-bye
Eleven is standing still,
Waiting for me to free him
By coming home

Moving me with a sound
Opening me within a gesture
Drawing me down and in,
Showing me where it all began,
Eleven

It took so long to realize that
You hold the light that's been leading me back home

Under a dead Ohio sky,
Eleven has been and will be waiting,
Defending his light,
And wondering
Where the hell have I been?
Sleeping, lost, and numb
So glad that I have found you
I am wide awake and heading home

Hold your light,
Eleven
Lead me through each gentle step by step
by inch, by loaded memory

I'll move to heal
As soon as pain allows, so we can
Reunite and both move on together

Hold your light,
Eleven...lead me through each gentle step by step
By inch, by loaded memory
'till one and one are one, eleven,
So glow, child, glow

I'm heading back home.

@SONG: Die Eier Von Satan

Eine halbe Tasse Staubzucker
Ein Viertel Teelöffel Salz
Eine Messerspitze türkisches Haschisch
Ein halbes Pfund Butter
Ein Teelöffel Vanillenzucker
Ein halbes Pfund Mehl
Einhundertfünfzig Gramm gemahlene Nüsse
Ein wenig extra Staubzucker
... und keine Eier

In eine Schüssel geben
Butter einrühren
Gemahlene Nüsse zugeben und
Den Teig verkneten

Augenballgroße Stücke vom Teig formen
Im Staubzucker wälzen und
Sagt die Zauberwörter
Simsalbimbamba Saladu Saladim

Auf ein gefettetes Backblech legen und
Bei zweihundert Grad für fünfzehn Minuten backen und
KEINE EIER

Bei zweihundert Grad für fünfzehn Minuten backen und
Keine Eier ..

@SONG: Pushit

I will choke until I swallow
Choke this infant here before me
What is this but my reflection?
Who am I to judge and strike you down?

But you're
Pushing and shoving me
You still love me and you pushit on me

Rest your trigger on my finger,
bang my head upon the fault line
Take care not to make me enter
'cause if I do, we both may disappear

But you're pushing me,
Shoving me...pushit on me

Slipping back into the gap again
I'm alive when you're touching me,
Alive when you're shoving me down

But i'd trade it all
For just a little bit of
Piece of mind

Put me somewhere I don't wanna be
Seeing someplace I don't wanna see
Never wanna see that place again

Saw that gap again today
As you were begging me to stay
Managed to push myself away,
And you, as well

If, when I say I may fade like a sigh if I stay,
You minimize my movement anyway,
I must persuade you another way

There's no love in fear

Staring down the hole again.

Some say the end is near
Some say we'll see armageddon soon
I certainly hope we will
I sure could use a vacation from this

Bullshit three ring circus sideshow of
Freaks

Here in this hopeless fucking hole we call LA
The only way to fix it is to flush it all away
Any fucking time...any fucking day
Learn to swim, I'll see you down in Arizona bay

Fret for your figure and
Fret for your latte and
Fret for your hairpiece and
Fret for your lawsuit and
Fret for your prozac and
Fret for your pilot and
Fret for your cable and
Fret for your car
It's a
Bullshit three ring circus sideshow of
Freaks

Here in this hopeless fucking hole we call LA
The only way to fix it is to flush it all away
Any fucking time...any fucking day
Learn to swim, I'll see you down in Arizona bay

Some say a comet will fall from the sky
Followed by meteor showers and tidal waves
Followed by faultlines that cannot sit still
Followed by millions of dumbfounded dipshits

Some say the end is near
Some say we'll see armageddon soon
I certainly hope we will, cuz
I sure could use a vacation from this

Silly shit, stupid shit

One great big festering neon distraction,
I've a suggestion to keep you all occupied

Learn to swim

Mom's gonna fix it all soon
Mom's comin' round to put it back the way it ought to be

Learn to swim

Fuck retro anything
Fuck your tattoos
Fuck all you junkies and
Fuck your short memory

Learn to swim

Fuck L Ron Hubbard and
Fuck all his clones
Fuck all those gun-toting
Hip gangster wannabes

Learn to swim

Fuck smiley glad-hands
With hidden agendas
Fuck these dysfunctional,
Insecure actresses

Learn to swim

Cuz I'm praying for rain
And I'm praying for tidal waves
I wanna see the ground give way
I wanna watch it all go down
Mom, please flush it all away
I wanna watch it go right in and down
I wanna watch it go right in
Watch you flush it all away

Time to bring it down again
Don't just call me pessimist
Try and read between the lines
I can't imagine why you wouldn't
Welcome any change, my friend

I wanna see it all come down.
